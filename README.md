FoodyApp is a mobile application developed using Kotlin in Android Studio. The app displays the locations of restaurants and integrates with maps, utilizing ArcGIS SDKs as part of its mapping functionality. Key features include displaying nearby restaurants by retrieving the user's current location and showing restaurants within a specified radius on the map. The app uses maps from the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android, displaying restaurant locations through FeatureLayer or GraphicsOverlay. Restaurant data is retrieved from Firebase and includes geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) along with metadata such as name, address.
